## Reflection:

While building this site, I made a few assumptions. One was that, once finding the hotel of their choice, the user would continue on finding it on their own with their research. My thought process process was to display the information from the Expedia Hotel API and display it as clearly as possible. In case the user needed some context to the location, I added a link to that location's Google Maps.

If I were to keep working on this project, I would include an editing feature, as well as other calls to action other than "Learn More" such as "Find Hotels and Attractions Nearby".
